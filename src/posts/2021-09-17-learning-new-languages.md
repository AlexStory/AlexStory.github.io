# New Languages

I'm somewhat of a programming language enthusiast. And I thought I'd go over some of the things that I like to use when I am first trying to pick up a new programming language.

## Official Language Docs

The first place I check is always the official language documentation. For example [elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) has a great little tutorial on their official site.

## Exercism

A great next place to look, whether the official site had a tutorial or not is [exercism](https://exercism.io). Exercism has fantastic tutorials to teach you some of the syntax, basics, and style of dozens of languages. I used this when I first picked up elixir and F# and it was invaluable.

## Advent Of Code

[Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com) is a wonderful site. This is what I use to actually get used to the language, and figure things out for myself after learning the syntax and such. It does a set of coding challenges every year, running from December 1st, to the 25th giving you two challenges a day. I did the whole thing in F# last year and it was great. I'm planning on going through all of the previous years as well and working on those.
